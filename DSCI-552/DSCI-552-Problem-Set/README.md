# Machine Learning Course Projects

This repository contains my machine learning projects completed as part of my academic coursework. Each project explores different aspects of machine learning, including regression models, classification, clustering, and neural networks. 

Here's a brief description of each project:

## 1. [Linear Regression Models (L1 and L2 Regularization)](https://github.com/rantao-usc/ml-projects/blob/master/DSCI-552/DSCI-552-Problem-Set/Problem-Set-1/Cars.ipynb)

This project focuses on the prediction of second-hand car prices. It implements Linear Regression models with L1 and L2 regularization techniques, which are particularly useful in handling overfitting and multicollinearity problems.

- **Technology Stack**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy

## 2. [Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/rantao-usc/ml-projects/blob/master/DSCI-552/DSCI-552-Problem-Set/Problem-Set-2/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

In this project, a Logistic Regression model is used to predict whether a treatment is effective for a new patient. Performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as the Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, ROC Curve, and AUC Score.

- **Technology Stack**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

## 3. [K-means Clustering](https://github.com/rantao-usc/ml-projects/blob/master/DSCI-552/DSCI-552-Problem-Set/Problem-Set-3/Untitled.ipynb)

This project employs the K-means clustering algorithm to identify patients similar to a specific patient (Patient Z) in a given dataset. The optimal number of clusters was determined using an Inertia plot and Silhouette Score plot. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to visualize the clustering results.

- **Technology Stack**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

## 4. [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model](https://github.com/rantao-usc/ml-projects/blob/master/DSCI-552/DSCI-552-Problem-Set/Problem-Set-4/551%20Final%20Project.ipynb)

A CNN model is used in this project to sort chest X-ray images into three categories. Data augmentation was employed to handle the issue of data imbalance.

- **Technology Stack**: Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Numpy, Matplotlib

## 5. [Naïve Bayes and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Models](https://github.com/rantao-usc/ml-projects/blob/master/DSCI-552/DSCI-552-Problem-Set/Problem-Set-5/Twitter%20data%20sentiment%20classification.ipynb)

This project features a Naïve Bayes model and a RNN model to classify the emotion of Twitter data (Text Classification). It demonstrates the application of both traditional and deep learning methods for text classification tasks.

- **Technology Stack**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy

## 6. [Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model for Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/rantao-usc/ml-projects/blob/master/DSCI-552/DSCI-552-Problem-Set/Problem-Set-6/3.%20Multivariate%20single%20timestep%20prediction.ipynb)

The final project involves the prediction of temperatures based on historical records using an RNN model, showcasing the utility of RNNs in time series analysis.

- **Technology Stack**: Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy

Please refer to the individual project folders for specific details, including the dataset description, code, and results. Suggestions for improvement are always welcome.

## Dependencies

Most of the projects in this repository require the following Python libraries:
